/*
 * You have a cannon object available to you which can send out projectiles. 
 * The projectiles don't move terribly quickly but they will destroy your enemy
 * if they hit.
 * 
 * The cannon object attached to this has the following methods:
 *
 * cannon.aim()  - returns the current direction the cannon is pointing.
 * cannon.aim(number) - points the cannon in the supplied direction.
 * cannon.fire() - fires a projectile.
 * cannon.ready() - tests to see if the cannon can be fired again.  The cannon
 *    requires a cooldown period after each firing.
 *
 *
 * Go up the elevator.
